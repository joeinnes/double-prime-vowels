# Double Prime Vowels
Often, font designers neglect to create glyphs for the Hungarian long vowels. Generally, browsers will display ugly fallback alternatives to these glyphs. This package provides a (sort of) solution for this problem.

It's not a perfect solution, but it's a start. The way this works is that the double prime symbol (which looks a bit like quotation marks but a bit more slanted) is used here to simulate an actual long acute accent.

This glyph is commonly included in font packs because it's the correct way to mark inches.

It won't look quite right, but hopefully it will look better than the ugly fallback, and it saves you finding a new font (although you should probably do that).
