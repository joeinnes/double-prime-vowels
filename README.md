# Double Prime Vowels
Often, font designers neglect to create glyphs for the Hungarian long vowels. Generally, browsers will display ugly fallback alternatives to these glyphs. This package provides a solution for this problem.

It's not a perfect solution, but it's a start.

The double prime symbol, used to indicate inches normally, is used here to simulate an actual long acute accent.

It won't look quite right, but hopefully it will look better than the ugly fallback, and it saves you finding a new font (although you should probably do that).
